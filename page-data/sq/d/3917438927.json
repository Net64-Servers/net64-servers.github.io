Don’t forget that Super Mario 64 normally doesn’t even know there is something like a client or even the internet in general. Currently the client just reads the local player’s position (and some other properties) from a fixed location and writes the remote players’ positions at another fixed location. For what Net64 currently does this is sufficient. For more elaborate internet play this solution will fall apart. Syncing non player objects requires more than just sending positions around. Objects are created, modified and destroyed all the time in Super Mario 64 and all those events have to reach the remote players. With the current solution those events could be missed accidentally or be sent twice to every player. The players would graduately desync over time. To prevent this we created a protocol that ensures events (or messages as they are internally called) are received perfectly in order and without getting lost or magically doubling.

It has a decent performance, but for an MMO with hundreds of players, CPU performance can become a bottleneck.
