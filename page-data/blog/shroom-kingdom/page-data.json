not a good idea and actively tried to stop me.\nI think this comes from a misinformation about blockchain in general.\nMany people try to stop what blockchain stands for and if you don’t take a deeper look into the technology,\nyou can soon develop a bad attitude towards blockchain.\nWhat people most refer to is the immense amount of energy the blockchain requires to operate.\nThis is however only true for blockchains that use Proof of Work (PoW) as its consensus algorithm.\nI have also the opinion, that PoW can be easily abused and hard to regulate where the energy that flows in comes from.\nHowever there are other consensus algorithms, that don’t have these problems like Proof of Stake.\nThis is one reason why I chose

also makes it possible to add utility to your NFTs,\ne.g. imagine an RPG game where every piece of armor you acquire is actually an NFT on the blockchain.\nThe NFT would directly impact the game

Kingdom, you will need game assets from Super Mario Maker 2.\nThis can be done by dumping game files from a real console and extract the required assets.\nI don’t want to encourage people to pirate the game to be able to play on Shroom Kingdom,\nwhich is why I will also implement support for game mods.\nThere is a huge amount of custom assets, that can instead be used, if you don’t own the game
