That means you no longer play in separate worlds where only the player models can interact with each other but be able to cooperatively interact with the environment. If a player collects a coin it disappears for everyone. The coin counter will increment for everyone and if this was the 100th coin to be collected in the course a star will appear for everyone.

This has the advantage of not requiring modifications to the ROM and being relatively simple to program. The disadvantages however are that it sometimes simply doesn’t work, it might require loading a savestate and it doesn’t allow us to modify everything in Super Mario 64.

This has been an easy solution since we can rely on Project64 to do most of the work (controller mapping, window creation, etc). Sadly this approach is very unreliable. In fact most people who try to play Net64 fail at this exact step. To counter this problem we embedded the popular Mupen64Plus emulator into the new client. It is now a single program so you just have to join a server and the emulator automatically starts Super Mario 64.

For example where players are, which objects are synced, when a player joins, if an object was interacted with and many other things. This sounds easier than it actually is. Don’t forget that Super Mario 64 normally doesn’t even know there is something like a client or even the internet in general. Currently the client just reads the local player’s position (and some other properties) from a fixed location and writes the remote players’ positions at another fixed location. For what Net64 currently does this is sufficient. For more elaborate internet play this solution will fall apart. Syncing non player objects requires more than just sending positions around. Objects are created, modified and destroyed all the time in Super Mario 64 and all those events have to reach the remote players. With the current solution those events could be missed accidentally or be sent twice to every player. The players would graduately desync over time. To prevent this we created a protocol that ensures events (or messages as they are internally called) are received perfectly in order and without getting lost or magically doubling. It’s like a network tunnel from Super Mario 64 to the Net64 client."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"video","properties":{"width":427,"height":519,"autoPlay":true,"loop":true},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n  "},{"type":"element","tagName":"source","properties":{"src":"/785dbe7571481da66e9a11158bcea29f/coin_star_collecting.mp4","type":"video/mp4"},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n  Your browser does not support video.\n"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Super Mario 64 sending coin collected messages into the client’s console."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"hr","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"So here’s an overview of the architectural changes between Net64 2.0 and Net64 3.0:"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"img","properties":{"src":"/3615711269c1cc57cbad5eaa7189033a/net64_2_vs_net64_3.svg","alt":"Net64"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"hr","properties":{},"children":[]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h2","properties":{"id":"caveats"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Any Caveats?"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Yes.
